# SQL-Game-Project

<h2>Hello and welcome to the "Catch the Fish" game.
  
<h3>This game is written entirely in SQL language, in the SSMS environment, in the developer version of SQL SERVER.
  
<h3>In order to play the game, you need to access the Procedures Script and execute the code.
  
<h3>After you did that, you need to open the game script and execute the procedures. You can also type your own details and see what happened.
  
Game Script contains all the commands to execute the game.
  
Procedures Script contains all the commands of building the game script.
  
In the Procedures Script we used different type of commands like DDL to create the data base and then the tables. We also used DML to manipulate the data.
  
Another important commands we used a lot in the project:
  
<h2>Variables, Stored Procedures, joins, scalar functions, While loops, IF, Exists and moreâ€¦
  
<h3>We also highly recommend you download the word document to understand the game and the code as well.
